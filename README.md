# Seekur-comunication-api
This api is created to simplify the process of writing applications for Seekur Jr from MobileRobots. This api's connection is based on ZMQ library. Most names of functions are the same as in original Aria library, but they are available on your local computer. Proper server running on robot is of course required. It will be available on the same github soon.
